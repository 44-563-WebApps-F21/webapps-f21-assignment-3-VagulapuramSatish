<h4>Scott Pilgrim</h4>
<p>Bassist for a middling Toronto garage band called Sex Bob-Omb, boyfriend to a too-young high-schooler, passive to the point of slacker paralyzation – Bryan Lee O’Malley’s alternative comic Scott Pilgrim vs. The World created an alternative superhero, a 23-year-old townie layabout who meets his dream girl. There’s just one catch: He can’t get to her without fighting her “Seven Evil Exes” first. Edgar Wright’s screen adaptation turns its Pilgrim (played by Michael Cera) into a powered-up arcade character, walloping all comers for level-ups and bonus coins. For a certain breed of culture-addled young romantic, he’s the most identifiable of superheroes – and a good lesson in not getting hung up in your partner’s romantic history.</p>
